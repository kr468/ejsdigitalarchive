## A Four-Part Series on Environmental Justice History in South Baltimore

**Part 1: Hawkins Point & Disposal:**
The opening film in this four-part environmental justice series tells the story of South Baltimore's neighborhood, Hawkins Point. Hawkins Point, a peninsula connected to Curtis Bay by I-695, is both representative of the history of South Baltimore and a key node in Baltimore’s current waste infrastructure system. Hawkins Point was once a rural neighborhood at the edge of the city, known as a place where fruit trees and farm animals were abundant. But by 1982, the accumulations of toxic waste industry had made the neighborhood so dangerous and unhealthy that its residents chose to be bought out by the State of Maryland so they could move elsewhere. This buyout marked a turning point in which Hawkins Point was effectively reclassified from a vibrant neighborhood to a space completely dominated by waste and industry.

**Part 2: Fairfield & Segregation**
The second film tells the story of South Baltimore's neighborhood, Fairfield and its erasure and significance. In the early 20th century, Baltimore became the “birthplace of American Apartheid,” where the city’s segregationist policies later served as a model for institutionalized zoning discrimination nationwide (Brown 2019). Racial zoning ordinances that institutionalized segregation and spatial containment created a modern South Baltimore that remains largely inhabited by people of color whose industrial proximity jeopardizes their health, among much else.

**Part 3: Westport: Grounds for Change**
The third film focuses on South Baltimore's Westport neighborhood and its toxic infrastructure. BRESCO, Baltimore's largest, most polluting waste facility, was chosen to be hosted in the residential neighborhood of Westport by Baltimore officials in 1981 after protests from the majority white communities of North Baltimore. Although the residents of Westport–largely low-income and African American–resisted the facility’s establishment, their voices were ignored by city officials, following Baltimore’s historic tendencies for red-lining and environmental racism. Ever since, residents of Westport have endured health-adverse and even lethal amounts of lead, hydrochloric acid, nitrogen oxide, mercury, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide.

**Part 4: Curtis Bay & Transformation**
We conclude this four-part environmental justice series with Curtis Bay. This episode offers a unique story about the organizing, activism, and innovative ideas coming out of the outspoken people of Curtis Bay, and it also helps the viewer to connect all the stories and themes of this series together. Hawkins Point, Fairfield, Westport, and Curtis Bay all share a history with and the challenge of waste as a tool of racial, social, and economic suppression in Baltimore. By restating the role waste has in marginalizing, shaping, and even activating these communities, the audience can hopefully begin to realize how waste is not just a byproduct of human activity. Waste can be, and is used by governing bodies all around the world, as a tool to devalue select (often marginalized) peoples and enact quiet violence against them. This cannot be forgotten in future environmental justice organizing and planning for places like South Baltimore. If the state fails to confront the role waste plays in perpetuating inequality, it will continue to undermine community efforts to address environmental justice in South Baltimore.
